>>> In Java, an interface is a blueprint for a class that contains abstract methods (methods without a body) and constants. Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.   

>>> Implicit Access Modifier:
         Methods in an interface are always public and abstract by default.

>>> VARIABLES  in an Interface:

        VAR in an interface are always public, static, and final by default.  You cannot declare fields as private or protected.
