Abstract class: 

>It is a class that contains abstract methods (methods without a body) and can also have concrete methods (methods with a body).
>In Java, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and must be subclassed by other classes. It is used to represent 
common characteristics of a group of related classes, providing a base for other classes to extend and implement abstract methods.

>Abstract classes can have constructors and member variables (fields), which can be inherited by subclasses.



@Access specifiers: 
   
    These are used to set the visibility of classes, methods, and fields. Common access specifiers are:

public: Accessible from anywhere.
protected: Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
Default (no specifier): Accessible only within the same package.
